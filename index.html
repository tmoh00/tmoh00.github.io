		<h2>
		Buying Cod
                </h2>
	The key to cooking good fish is to buy it fresh - frozen food never makes for a good meal. Although it might be a little expensive, it's worth spending the money to get a good meal on the table. <br>
	When shopping for fish, it's essential to buy the best cut possible, even if that means waiting another half hour for fresh cuts to roll out. When buying cod, you should check for two things: color and smell. <br>
		<ol>
		Smell: The fish should have a weak smell to it. If the cut smells too strong, you might be buying a rotten cut.
                </ol>
		<ol>
		Color: Fresh cod is always a distinctive white color, with silvery stripes running through the center of the fillet. If the fish appears to be pink, then you're either looking at the wrong fish (tilapia) or you have an old cut on your hands. Dry edges or flaking are also common things to avoid. 
		</ol>
		<h2>
		Ingredients
		</h2>
	For this recipe, you'll need an eight-ounce cut of fish (cod for this recipe), one teaspoon of 100% lemon juice, two ounces of salted butter, two sprigs of rosemary, two tablespoons of thyme, and a tablespoon each of salt and pepper (crushed peppercorn is also an option). <br>
		<h2>
		Preparing Cod
		</h2>
		<li>
		Use the knife to separate the cod into two-inch rectangles. They don't have to be exact. Set aside for now.
		</li>
		<li>
		In a separate bowl, mix the salt and pepper together with the thyme. Since they're dry ingredients, spoons aren't necessary. Just slosh the ingredients around in the dry bowl. Mix in the lemon juice as the ingredients are mixed.
		</li>
		<li>
		Rub the fillet pieces down with the seasoning and lemon juice, coating both sides evenly.
		</li>
		<li>
		Chop up the sprigs of rosemary and sprinkle them on top of the fillets. Keep them flat on the plate for now. 
		</li>
		<li>
		Preheat the pan or skillet with a teaspoon of vegetable oil on medium. When the oil starts popping, place the fish (herb side up) on the pan. 
		</li>
		<li>
		When the fish is about three-quarters cooked, flip it onto the other side and melt the butter in one corner of the pan. Do not make contact until most of the butter is melted.
		</li>
		<li>
		Carefully move the fish around until the butter coats one side of it. Cook for another two minutes and flip with extreme caution, as the fish is now very fragile. Plate and serve immediately.
		</li>
